# Building Component Libraries

### Simple Component Libraries

Building basic component libraries with Twux is easy...

```tsx
const theme = {
  button: twux("text-white bg-blue-500 p-2 rounded", "button"),
  title: twux("text-2xl font-bold", "h1"),
};
```

Usage:

```tsx
<theme.button>Click me!</theme.button>
<theme.title>Hello World</theme.title>
```

### Best Practices for Most Component Libraries

For most component libraries that will be re-used through a project, we
recommend the following pattern for easier management...

- Create one file to export components.
- Create a second file to export the theme in one namepsace.

Example:

```tsx
// theme-exports.ts
export const button = twux("text-white bg-blue-500 p-2 rounded", "button");
export const title = twux("text-2xl font-bold", "h1");
```

```tsx
// theme.ts
export * as theme from "./theme-exports";
```

Usage:

```tsx
import { theme } from "./theme";

<theme.button>Click me!</theme.button>
<theme.title>Hello World</theme.title>
```

### Reasoning

- **Object management is finicky**: Managing an object with names keys is more finicky than exporting a single `const` (e.g. bracket mismatches)
- **Function and variable sharing**: Easy to create shared utility functions and shared variables that can be interspersed between the exports which can only be down before the `object` approach
- **Selective exports**: Easy to selectively disable or enable exports from the theme without having to remove them from the object
- **Additional exports**: Easy to export additional values as types
